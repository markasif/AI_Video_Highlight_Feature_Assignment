"There's two types of people who've\nwatched my videos and message me there's\nthe people and it's not nowhere in\nbetween either they have fully pushed to\nthe end and created basically a full app\nthat they love or they got stuck on like\nthe first few steps and gave up once you\nget the aha moment where you're like oh\nthis works and you realize that like\nyou're in charge you don't need to ask\nanyone like influencer you don't need an\ninfluencer or a teacher you just need to\nask ai you need to ask claude be like\n.\n Hey it didn't work for this.\n And it might\nnot give you the right answer on the\nfirst try but odds are by the second or\nthird try like you will will your way to\na working app.\n I it's guaranteed i just\nthink it separates the high agency\npeople and the low agency.\n People uh\npretty\n[music]\nwell um\nriley welcome to the show this is a\nstartup ideas podcast where we talk\nabout startup ideas but we're not\nnecessarily talking about startup ideas\ntoday we're talking about how to how to\nuse some so ai tools to build software\n.\n Right.\n Yeah\n.\n Um it's gotten a lot easier to create\nwebsites uh whether it's landing pages\nall the way on the other side of the\nspectrum like creating apps like notion\n.\n I i've been creating i mean it takes six\nor seven hours if you like really want\nto go ham to create something that looks\na lot like notion but with a full\ndatabase storage and everything um fully\nwith ai without writing a single line of\ncode.\n So so basically a 12 billion dollar\ncompany you can clone a lot of how it\nworks.\n Well i'll give notion credit i\nmean they have a lot of it's.\n It's a the\nskeleton of these apps but like you can\nremix them as we were talking before\nthis there's certain apps i'm like i\nwish i had this feature i wish i had\nthis feature and this feature i'm like\nwait why don't i just kind of screenshot\nthe app tell the ai you know this is the\ngeneral uh kind generally the way that\nyou use the app.\n And then you can just\nsay but i also want to have these\nfeatures and then if you have the grit\nto push through the errors because\nthere's a lot of errors once you start\ndealing with\ndatabases but usually claude will figure\nit out and the more times you do it the\nbetter you will be at like fixing those\nerrors and and you get better at problem\nsolving just like anything and you can\ncreate some really cool things in like\n10 to 15 hours of practice and that's\nwhat we're going to do today and by the\nend of this video you'll have a good\nidea and then you can start playing with\nyourself and start creating\nsoftware\nabsolutely um do you want me to just hop\ninto yes.\n All right let's just do this\n.\n Okay um has there cing session this is\nlike live cooking you're the chef.\n All\nright let's let's do this here.\n Okay.\n So\ni'm going to share this screen is there\nbeen any good sas ideas that you' guys\nhave come up with i know you do those\nlive\nsessions have you guys thought of\nanything\nrecently\nyes uh you want me to pull one\nup sure i mean it's like the easiest way\nto use these tools is if you have some\nsort of idea in mind.\n But i guess without\nan idea in mind um let's uh i guess i'll\ntalk about what tools i want to talk\nabout today.\n So this right here is v0 so\nthis is going to be uh this is front end\nuh and it's using nextjs which i\nliterally have not coded i 50 days ago i\nhad never coded in my life so i was like\nthe first day i found claw artifacts and\nthen i started plugging that code into\nrepet but what vz does is it lets you\ncreate these really cool front ends that\nlook amazing and what we can do is we\ncan\nsay i want to create an app\nthat help me out here.\n Uh what do you uh\nlet's let's do something let's do a sas\napp um let's do like a f one of those\nfaceless video app creators can we do\nsomething like that.\n Okay um\n.\n Yes that's harder.\n But.\n Yeah.\n Yeah um what\nabout uh what about like an app that\ntook your transcript of one of your\nvideos divided them into startup ideas\nand then made like a presentation out of\nthem that sounds amazing because yeah\nlet's do that okay\n.\n So let's just let's this is where you\nkind of look at the shell.\n Right we're\nnot going to on vzer we're not going to\nbe able to add any ai features because\nthat's all going to be done on the back\nend.\n So let's think about layout so like\nwhat types of things would you want if\nyou uh if you were to talking to someone\non your podcast about startup ideas what\nwould you want to know about them so\nlike you have your uh you have just like\nthe idea you have i guess like business\nmarket how big it is how small it is i\nlike um for for me what's important is\nto know what are the other big audience\ninternet audiences and\ncommunities uh in that\nspace so that just gives me more\nideas.\n Okay.\n So i guess um let's just call\nit internet uh\naudience um and then the idea is just\nthe uh main\nstartup idea the market will be um\nmarket uh market\ndescription.\n Yes and then market size and\nwe can start with that because we can\nalways add to it.\n But i think this is a\ngood start.\n So i want you to create a\nlet's call it a presentation\ncard a presentation\ncard uh or\nslide as if it was going to be in a\npitch deck about a startup\nidea.\n And i let's just say make it a\nreally slick\nuh\ndesign uh with\ncool uh\nsubtle\nanimations could you say could you say\nflat\ndesign shh don't tell anyone.\n But i've\ngot 30 plus startup ideas that could\nmake you millions.\n And i'm giving them\naway for free these aren't just random\nguesses they're validated concepts from\nentrepreneurs who built hundred million\nplus businesses i've compiled them into\none simple\ndatabase compiled from hundreds of\nconversations i've had on my podcast but\nthe main thing is most of these ideas\ndon't need a single investor some cost\nnothing to start i'm pretty much handing\nyou a cheat cheet the idea bank is your\nstartup\nshortcut just click below to get\naccess your next cash flowing business\nis waiting for you instead of slick\nokay do slick slick slf flat flat is a\ntype of design i just want to see if it\nit knows what that is it's a little i\ndon't even know i don't know what that\nis i'm curious i'm no\ndesigner but v0 lets me offload a lot of\nthat and it also allows me to just like\ntake things that i like and let's see\nwe're actually going to see it work in\nreal time so\nsee it's kind of nice.\n And i like the\num i like this\nactually so what's happening now is it's\nliterally building like the front end\nfor this is that what's happening.\n Yeah\n.\n So we can actually see the code right\nhere.\n So we're going to be using nextjs i\nhave a template that allows me to very\nquickly create nexj uh nextjs apps so my\npartner and i an who is a developer\nand his main passion is like teaching\npeople how to code.\n And he's been\nincredibly helpful in teaching me and so\nwe're building the most annoying part\nabout coding is what he calls plumbing\nwhere you have to go in you have to set\nup all the libraries and you have to\nmake sure that you're organizing your\nfiles in the proper manner and when i\nwas first starting that would take me\nthree hours just to get to the point\nwhere i could put an idea that i had\ninto a website.\n But we're actually just\ndoing all of that work so that you could\nstart from from that exact point where\nyou've done all the plumbing where you\nstill have all the\npossibilities you've just done all the\nboring work like install the libraries\nbecause vzero opera it has all of these\ndifferent libraries already downloaded\nwhich is why it can render this normally\nyou'd have to download a bunch of things\nto do it because coding is a lot of just\nlibraries and it's kind of boring.\n Um but\nwhat you can also do on vz.\n You can\nactually say make changes so like make\nuh changes\nto this\ncard i want\nto uh make changes to this card i want\nto have a\nborder around the\nedges and\nadd uh clean add light dots in the\nbackground as if it's graph paper uh\nvery\nuh light.\n And uh what's the word\ntransparent.\n And i just want to go over\nthe example that you can kind of alter\nthese uh and it just edits these live so\nit'll look back at the one it previously\ncreated and it will create a new one and\nso this is a lot like clawed artifacts\nbut like on\nsteroids and this is crazy.\n Yeah.\n So you\nsee that if you see those dots in the\nbackground it it's kind of a nice little\nnice touch there and it added the nice\nborder and so you can always go back and\nsee so we can see this one and we can go\nback and look at the previous version\nwhich didn't have a border nor those\ndots can i add one quick thing.\n Yeah.\n I\ndon't know how to.\n And i want to see how\nyou'd prompt this so on my podcast i say\neither an idea is sip or spit sip is if\ni really like the idea like startup\nideas podcast and spit is if i really\ndon't like the idea how can we put how\ncan we do a prompt so we can show if the\nideas is is sip or spit.\n Oh wow.\n Okay we\ncould actually make this useful\num wait hold on.\n Okay.\n What if you\nhad um a section of your show where\npeople submitted startup ideas to your\nshow via a text prompt.\n Yes.\n And then it\nconverted it into this.\n And then it gave\nyou like a toggle where you could either\ndrag it to the right for almost like\ntinder for sip or spit and based on what\nyou do there then we'll add an animation\nleft for like we could even add a sound\neffect too we could do that um and uh we\ncould even add little light background\nmusic too\num let me think about this for a sec um\nokay see this is the fun part this is i\ni love this process of like coming up\nwith an idea now i'm like thinking.\n Okay\nwhat have i done like this before um and\ni think i think i got it.\n Okay\n.\n So let's just describe this also i use\nvoice a lot when i'm making\nthese so i want to add an\nevaluation popup and this um i want you\nto\ninclude an icon and just have a\nplaceholder uh image of a\nperson.\n And i want this to have i want to\nbe able to drag this icon to the left\nwhich is spit and i or drag it to the\nright which is sip sip is positive spit\nis negative sip should be a green should\nbe green spit should be\nred uh add a positive\nanimation to the entire card when it\ngets dragged to spit and change the\ncolor\nto uh change the border color to green\nand for spit change the border color to\nred.\n And we can alter these animations\ntoo um and this will just take a second\nto load what i just said um uh the\npurpose of this is to evaluate this\nstartup idea so that i can look an idea\ndrag it in a certain direction and uh we\ncan label it as either good or bad which\ni call sip and spit i like to make sure\ni give it i tell it the purpose because\nit will actually use that in the prompt\nand it might add to its creativity so\nlet's just try this and it might take a\nfew times to get it right because this\none's a little bit more\nadvanced that's interesting that you\ngave it the purpose like you really did\ntreat it like a a\ncoworker.\n Well it'll it knows what types\nof animations it's trained on data.\n Oh\nwhat's it doing down here.\n Okay.\n Okay.\n Okay\nhold on is this a\ndrag.\n Oh my god wait this isn't make this\na slider let's just make it a circle for\nnow i was going to make it your face uh\nonce we actually make it into a thing so\ni want\nto um i want to drag the\ncircle in a\ndirection and that causes the green or\nred\nborder uh let's say the\nslider should be right below the\ncard\nand and if you\ndrag actually we'll add that next um\nshould be right below the card the user\nshould be able to drag it in either\ndirection by the way i'm happy that\nmistakes are happening right now because\nthe whole point of this video is for\npeople to learn how how you approach\nproblems\ntoo.\n Yeah.\n And i think people don't\nrealize how on twitter in youtube you\nsee all the highlight reels um of people\ncreating amazing things with ai.\n And you\ncan absolutely do that o.\n I like this\ndude that's actually amazing that's fire\n.\n All right please let me do it all right\nso let's see okay.\n All right.\n So it says\ngreat idea and then uh needs impr wait\nis there.\n Oh you could add like um tiar\nso like a mini spit or like pretty good\nidea.\n And then really good idea depending\non how far you slide it we could do that\npretty easily um.\n But i i like the just\nit's either a spit or a spit or a sip or\na spit um\nplease\nchange the border\ncolor\ndepending on the way um depending on\num depending on the\ndecision made by the\nuser and\nthen.\n And then the popup message you have\nat the bottom should be sip or\nspit um let me see what happens if we\nzoom out here.\n Oh yeah.\n That's actually\nreally clean uh make the line thicker\nand the\nfont for sip\nor or spit\nlarger.\n I'll try that one so instead of\nyou know i went to computer science\nschool so instead of writing code what\nyou're doing is you're speaking\nenglish and then the code is coming out\n.\n I call it composing code like you're\n.\n You're kind of um you're just kind of\nguiding it you're telling it what you\nwant and you know what things are\nfeasible and what\nwhat types of things aren't feasible the\nmore you do it um.\n And i think this looks\na lot cleaner what are your thoughts on\nthe line.\n Thickness solid.\n Yeah.\n It's it's\nreally nice.\n I like that it's it's thick\n.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n And\nthen\nboom um.\n All right let's just go one more\none more um uh now i want to create\nmultiple slides of this once.\n A decision\ndecision is made it should go to the\nnext startup idea.\n And then i should make\nuh the same\ndecision on the next one there should be\nan\nanimation once i\ndecide sip or\nspit make them\npositive or negative.\n All right last one\nand then we can i get nervous you know\ni'm like what what's what are they going\nto come up with well you can always\nrevert like i think you can retry this i\nactually haven't used this is the first\nday i've used this specific tool but\nit's very similar to the tools i've been\nusing i think you can redo it so there's\nnot a lot of pressure unless you're on a\npodcast um\n.\n Okay.\n Okay cool\nlet's um let's just try it wait why does\nit it's like reversed here.\n Okay wait let\nme reset this.\n I guess and while you're\nresetting it.\n I have one small design\ndetail i would like yeah changed i\nreally like the dots that you have in\nthe back.\n But i don't find them\npronounced\nenough is there anything you can you to\nhelp me absolutely hey um greg wants the\nuh dots uh less transparent so have them\nmore prominent and\nalso below the sip or spit bar uh it has\ntwo labels which is sip and spit those\nshould be reversed they should not you\nhave the sip on the left and spit on the\nright please reverse those and the anim\nis kind of weird.\n But like that's okay we\ncan always fix that later because i\nagree i think the dots i love the the\ndot look i've been using that a lot.\n Yeah\n.\n It adds a nice amount of of texture.\n Yeah\n.\n Like even like hores or diagonal grid\nlines are fun too i've noticed that i\nwill say i think knowing how to design\nor knowing some of the terminology is\nstill going to be super helpful so right\n1,000%.\n No no act like 1,000% taste is\neverything um and it's since i started\ndoing this.\n I'm now paying attention to\nevery website i don't go to a website\nanymore without thinking like oh my god\nlike how are they doing this or how can\ni replicate this or like what\nother tool could i create using this\ndesign method.\n And it's it's really fun\nand it helps you actually like develop\nyour taste for websites and finding cool\ndesigns because a lot of the best\ndesigns and this applies to video\nediting as well it's like below the\nlevel of your consciousness like you\ndon't notice it unless you're looking\nfor it.\n And it's fun.\n Once you okay now it\nit's flipped\neverything.\n Okay jesus um this actually\nlooks better though\num despite\nthe the it's off right.\n It has sip on the\nleft spit on the right so we need to ask\nfor one more change let's just do this\n.\n And then we can move on so um\nsip should be on the\nright\nspit should be on the left and we're\njust going to i'm just going to\nscreenshot this is another good lesson\n.\n Actually i'm glad this happened actually\nwe can screenshot this and you can\nactually bring it up and what i'm going\nto do here is i'm going to draw on this\nand so i'm literally going to i'm not\ngoing to use any colors we've already\nused before.\n And i'm just going to\ncircle these.\n And i'm just going to say\n.\n And then i just screenshot it again and\nthen copy it because it doesn't if you\ntry and copy that it doesn't copy so now\ni'm just going to paste that image in\nthere um and i'm going to say you see\nthe\nlabels.\n Oh those are the slides i just\nrealized what that is those are the\ndifferent slides like the first one is\nspit the second one is did you know that\nor am i don't.\n Okay.\n No.\n Okay.\n So like it's\nit's uh what it's doing is i just\nrealized what it's doing.\n Is it's like.\n A\num so once you go spit or here you see\nthat it's like that's your first the\nfirst one you did right.\n So if i go but\nit's reversed because they're all it's\nmessed up so might we might so okay\nactually.\n Okay sip should be on the right\nspit should be on the left\nplease switch them for\nthe ones i've circled in\nblue uh\nnumber those and make them gray no\nmatter what the choice was because i\nthink it's kind of confusing when it's\nlike this or maybe we i don't know but\nlet's just try this.\n But this is really\nuseful to screenshot because we can\nscreenshot any website we can go to any\nwebsite you think is cool and literally\nscreenshot it and then describe like\nwhat you should do with it and you can\nin one minute have a working prototype\nfor it it's not a full app because it's\nnot storing any of the data but it is a\nprototype it's pretty cool.\n All right i\nhope we get it on this one good so\nfar.\n Okay looks good now if we go sip\nboom now one was sip two is spit three\nis spit.\n And that's it.\n It's pretty cool\npretty darn cool.\n Pretty darn cool quick\nad break let me tell you about a\nbusiness i invested in it's called\nboring marketing.com so a few years ago\ni met this group of people that were\nsome of the best seo experts in the\nworld they were behind getting some of\nthe biggest companies found on google\nand the secret sauce is they've got a\nset of technology and ai that could help\nyou outrank your competition so for my\nown businesses i wanted that i didn't\nwant to have to rely on mark zuckerberg\ni didn't want to depend on ads to drive\ncustomers to my businesses i wanted to\nrank high in google that's why i like\nseo and that's why i use boring\nmarketing.com and that's why i invested\nin it they're so confident in their\napproach that they offer a 30-day sprint\nwith 100% money back guarantee who does\nthat nowadays so check it out highly\nrecommend.\n Boring marketing.com.\n Okay.\n So\nnow let's have some more fun here now\nwe're going to use a tool that has been\nthe most hyped tool since i don't know i\ncan't even remember uh for those of you\nwondering it's called cursor and what i\ndo so i have this template and you can\nlink it below we created this template\nand we've basically done all the dirty\nwork so this is nextjs which v0 is also\nnextjs so you can do a lot of the same\nthings and so that's where i come up\nwith just general\nideas about interface i take a bunch of\nscreenshots and then that then i'll give\nit to cursor to come up with the actual\napplication i'll show you guys here that\ni actually have let's go to my other\naccount\ni've set up before this episode i've set\nup a backend or a database storage and a\ndatabase storage and authentication so\nsigning in with google and everything\nthat you would need to actually turn it\ninto an app um if you also want to\ngather emails or gain users that's all\npart of this template i don't know if\nwe'll get there today but what i do with\nrepet.\n So this is repet this is what the\nthis is what we run the front end on\nthis is how we deploy the application\nand we basically connect cursor up to\nthis because cursor it's significantly\nharder to deploy apps for beginners\nrepet makes taking whatever you've\ncreated and putting it on the internet\nwith a domain that you can share right i\ncan share my domain with greg and he can\nopen the site and use the site and sign\nin or i can go to name cheep buy a\ndomain and i'll show you that process it\ntakes like 10 seconds and it's hosted\ndirectly on rep and so like 20 bucks a\nmonth or something you can host a\nwebsite and get that and firebase is\nfree until you've reached like a certain\namount of users so it's very very cheap\nnow there's like no excuses to uh to not\nget like an mvp up and vzero what's the\ncost of like what you did what are we\ntalking v0 is either it's either 15 or\n20 bucks a month or something um my ai\nbudget is over ,000 a month so like um i\ni lost track of the tools um but if you\ncompare that to a front-end designer\nright $15 a month right what's the\nhourly rate of a solid designer probably\nhundreds of dollars per hour um to me\nit's a no-brainer.\n So this is repet what\nwe need to do is we need to connect it\nto curser i don't believe i've done that\n.\n Yet so i'm actually going to close out\nof the project i was working on before\nand open up a new window and we're just\ngoing to do this really quickly uh for\nanyone who wants to use this template\nthis will actually be cool you can just\nopen the template and you're going to\nhit use template and this will take you\nexactly to this page then you're going\nto go uh then what you're going to do is\nwe're just going to open up secrets i\nthink i've already done this.\n But you'll\nhave to do this as well.\n And then we're\ngoing to also open up\nssh.\n And i have more videos on this if\ni'm going too fast but basically what\nyou need to do is you need to go to keys\n.\n And we're actually just going to put\nthis aside for now so we're going to\nleave it open with this keys tab in\ncursor you're going to press this button\ndown here to open up the terminal you're\ngoing to press command k we're going to\ntype uh generate an ssh key for repet\nname it repet and copy the public key to\nmy clipboard this seems scary because it\nis i still don't fully understand what\ni'm doing but this is how you set it up\nyou're going to press you're going to\nclick on whatever it generates right\nhere right after it enter y enter enter\nthat automatically copies this ssh key\nthat you then add right here i'm going\nto name it sip.\n Then i'm going to hit add\nkey then i'm going to hit connect i'm\ngoing to copy this connect manually key\nand we're going to hit open with ssh\nwe're paste it here we're not going to\nhit enter we're going to press add new\nssh host and we're going to paste it in\nright here and hit enter we're going to\nclick the top one click connect click\ncontinue.\n And then we're almost there you\nonly need to pay attention to this if\nyou actually want to use cursor but\ncursor is by far the most fun tool i've\never is the best software i've ever used\nin my life so you're going to want to\npay attention you might want to try it\n.\n Okay.\n So then you're going to click on\nthis this should match uh the name of\nthe project which it does sit pod and\nwe're going to hit.\n Okay.\n So now they're\nsynced right the template that i made uh\nwith an.\n And he put in the heavy lifting\nhe's a developer repet makes it very\neasy to share templates and makes it\nvery easy to deploy so you can very\nquickly download it and you can then\nwrite code and create stuff with it the\neditor on cursor is a lot better so\nwe're bas basically connecting repet and\nwe're connecting cursor now we've done\nthat now we're just going to we're going\nto open up the files that we need here\nso in source app and we're just going to\nhit page. Tx tsx and this is basically\nthe homepage of this of this template\nand now we can use the composer which is\nthe feature that is why cursor is going\nso viral this basically allows us to\nedit multip pages at once and so we can\nthen come here and say and we're\nactually just now building this out so\ni'm not fully confident this is going to\nwork but i'm going to take a risk here\ni'm going to say um or i'm going to just\nsay this is a next uh js app trying to\nthink of how we should do this okay\nlet's do this in order here.\n So i'm going\nto create a this nextjs app.\n And i want\nyou\nto um i want you to i just don't know\nhow we want to start like when should we\nadd the ai features to um i'm just going\nto start off i want you to\nto uh take the uh take\ninspiration from and what we're going to\ndo is we're going to use this paths so\nchat. Md i'll explain this after i do it\nactually we've used the template to\ncreate apps and when we do that success\nsuccessfully with a certain prompt we\nadd it to the project files so that\nother people can come here and use\ninspiration from the files that we've\nused and so the end game of this would\nbe a blank template where you can create\nanything but there's kind of 30 paths\nyou can go down of different types of\napps whether it's note taking basic chat\napp um and so let's just say i want you\nto take inspiration from chat md and\nlet's create um a basic\nchatbot where the user will put in\na\nstartup\nidea and you will\noutput the idea in let's go to v0 real\nquick let's just screenshot this co copy\nthis nope copy this\npaste that in um output the idea in text\nformat uh in format in this met with\nthese ideas ignore the styling i don't\nwant to worry about styling until a\nlittle bit later i just want to get the\nai text feature down so just\nhave uh idea market and internet\naudiences anytime you deal with ai\nfeatures it gets tough like this is when\nyou run into a lot of bugs i mean this\nis a hard thing to create and so the\nfact that you can do it in just a few\nbugs is impressive um let's just go\nahead and let's just see what it does so\ni'm going to hit command shift enter\nwhich will actually so now it's looking\nat all of these files which i never told\nit to use all of these files it's just\ngoing through right we can watch it code\nin the background like it's literally\nmaking changes um and telling us exactly\nwhat we need to\ndo um now it says npm install open ai\nedge.\n Okay i hope that's the right\ninstall anytime it says install\nsomething npm install open ai edge what\nyou need to do is you need to go to\nrepet.\n And you need to go to your shell\nand you need to paste that in right here\nand it does some magic stuff i still\ndon't understand it um it's it's\ndownloading libraries that it needs to\ndo this action so now what we can do is\nwhat i'm going to do is.\n I'm going to\nreset this so i'm going to hit the stop\nrunning.\n And then i'm just going to rerun\nit and then open up the web view in\ntheory the changes will be made after i\nhit save\nall um i'm going to hit save all i don't\nknow if it'll be added to the homepage\n.\n Yet we may need to connect it the the\napp that it just created back to the\nhomepage so i don't know if it's going\nto change anything anything so i'm going\nto hit save.\n All okay it is doing\nsomething it's hard to tell i don't see\nany errors.\n Okay.\n So now we have this\nstartup idea analyzer after one single\nprompt and we haven't accepted those\nchanges yet if you're using cursor hit\nsave all instead of accept all accept\nall is not reversible you have to ask\nthe ai to reverse it instead of just\nbeing able to like hit reject i can\nstill hit reject because i hit save all\njust throwing that out there okay\nstartup\nidea um let's go ahead.\n And i have a\nstartup idea for selling uh gummy bears\nat football\ngames what we're testing here is we just\nwant to know if this works.\n Right.\n So you\njust put in a test idea you might want\nto add one other thing um what other\nstuff did we have we had the market um\nfootball games in germany just to give\nit a market.\n Okay let's hit analyze idea\n.\n So what's going through your mind right\n.\n Now.\n Yeah.\n So what we've done here is in\nthis template that we're literally\nmaking i this is one that we're like in\nproduction making and uh this was a good\ntest for me so we have secrets in here\nso these are all api tokens so we have\nthe opening ai api key the uh replicate\napi key.\n So these are all tools that you\ncan use on the web that allow you to do\ncool things right.\n And a popular term is\num open ai rapper and what that is is\njust a software that someone created and\nit's using open ai and paying them a\nlittle bit every single time it's used\nso you're hoping that the monthly\ncharges that you're charging people will\noutweigh the amount you're paying open\nai for the usage basically and you can\nuse as many of these different apis and\na lot of like a tool light notion is\nusing a ton of different apis if you if\nit has google drive all these different\napplications but in this case for some\nreason it's not working so what i'm\ngoing to do is literally just tell\ncursor.\n Okay when when i entered my idea\ninto the input field nothing happened\nneed it to generate\nthe uh the output that we discussed and\nit has context of this so it'll know\nwhat you're talking about.\n And i just\nsometimes add please make this happen or\nlike i don't know you don't have to do\nthat um.\n And i'm just going to hit uh i'm\nfirst sometimes you're mean you're mean\nto to them is that what i i was\nhearing only when i get mad only when\nit's like fails 10 times in a row and\ni'm honest l glad this happened i have\ntalked to there's two types of people\nwhove watched my videos and message me\nthere's the people and it's not nowhere\nin between either they have fully pushed\nto the end and created basically a full\napp that they love or they got stuck on\nlike the first few steps and gave up\nonce you get the aha moment where you're\nlike.\n Oh this works and you um and you\nrealize that like you're in charge you\ndon't need to ask anyone like influence\nyou don't need an influencer or a\nteacher you just need to ask ai you need\nto ask claude be like hey it didn't work\nfor this and it might not give you the\nright answer on the first try but odds\nare by the second or third try like you\nwill will your way to a working app um\nit's guaranteed you just have to have i\njust think it separates the high agency\npeople and the low agency.\n People uh\npretty well something i've noticed uh so\nwe're just going to.\n Oh i should not have\nhit accept all.\n But that's i was just\ngoing to say\nyou slide devil you.\n It's.\n Okay.\n We'll\nwe'll be fine um let's go ahead and\nrefresh this i don't know why there's\nthese like horizontal lines here let's\nthat might be a function of a bad um\ntemplate prompt.\n So let's just paste in\nwhat we had earlier uh which was the\ngummy bears in germany can you please\nuse the open ai.\n Oh wait hold on uh\nmoment\nincoming open ai key in your environment\nvariable which we do it's.\n Open ai key\nright it should be called open ai key um\nit is called open ai key can we please\nuse the i think we should make this an\ninput field first and then use the ai\nfeatures because we're going to want the\nai to fill them in in specific ways well\nsee this is the hard part this is hard\nto make content on this because\nyou're um\n.\n Okay we need can you please add error\nlogs to\nthe um to the ai input field i have no\nway of\nknowing what the\nproblem is fair request is that\nsomething you've said before\num.\n Yeah.\n So i've been doing this a lot\n.\n Well usually you should get an error.\n The\nmost annoying part about this is we're\nnot getting any error it's just\nliterally doesn't say anything um it\nshould say either it should say a host\nof different things it should either say\napi is failing because like you have an\nincorrect api key it should literally\njust tell us what the problem is um but\nit's not telling us anything so we need\nto enter the sends probably going to\nfail analyze the idea.\n Something's wrong\ni don't know what's going on\num\nhold why is there no\nerror.\n Okay.\n I want to change the page\nwe'll we'll add the ai features second\nbecause i do want to add\nthat.\n Okay.\n I want to change the page um\nthe\nstartup idea analyze\nto just be an input\nfield and an\nenter\nbutton um for all the\nfields uh to\ncreate um for all the input fields to\ncreate a\nslide that looks like\nthis and what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to just paste this in here\nhere.\n Is the code that i use to\ndesign this card uh based on the input\nfield i\nwant um this\nto be created for that card.\n Okay now i'm\ngoing to come over to v0.\n And i'm just\ngoing\nto i'm just going to paste in here.\n And\nwe'll let it because it needs to\nrecreate it it's not going to use the\ncode because it's already has libraries\ndownloaded so this is\nfine.\n Okay.\n So what's\nhappening i just um i'm changing\nstrategies here so rather than have ai\ngenerate out in text\nform the startup idea in the format that\nwe want instead i'm going to create text\ninput field so we're going to manually\nput them in.\n And then we can ask ai to\ntake an idea and in the background\nbasically fill those in so we're\nactually just recreating the process if\nyou don't know to code this is a good\nway to do it is to actually create it\nmanually and then say i want to automate\nthis process and have that whole process\nhappen in the background so like the\nuser doesn't see it um because i don't\nreally know how there's a whole thing\nwith ai and object creation it's i don't\nfully understand it.\n So you can use.\n Other\nokay.\n So we need to install this.\n So let's\ninstall uh frame or motion so we're\ngoing to come over to the um we're going\nto come over to this right here we're\ngoing to go to the shell because you see\nnpm that means shell we're going to type\nin shell.\n And we're just going to paste\nthis in like this.\n And so it's installing\nframer motion and loose side react which\nis icons i believe um we might have\nalready had both of those downloaded not\nsure in the template but now i'm going\nto just stop this rerun it.\n And we're\ngoing to open up the web\nview\nand let's go ahead and press save\nall.\n Oh\nbrother i did something\nwrong this is the\nprocess.\n Oh i know what i can do.\n Okay.\n I'm\njustess going to revert here i really do\nthink we need to do better instructions\nfrom the get-go i'm just going to i'm\njust going to do\n.\n [music]\nit.\n Okay good good this is how it should\nhave looked when we were getting errors\num because this makes it very easy for\nus to it says we don't see frame or\nmotion so we can just easily paste in\nerror please advise and\nfix error messages are good blank\nscreens are bad\n.\n Right this is what should have popped up\nin the dev log.\n Right we should see the\nthe errors right here.\n And it actually\nknows what to do um and we can actually\njust see how it reacts so we can hit uh\nsave\nall.\n And then we're going to\nrefresh um i think it fixed one i think\nthere was multiple errors.\n And now we're\nonly\ngetting i think we're getting i think\nthis will fix.\n Oh do i need to add oh i\nneed to add frame or motion.\n Okay.\n Okay\n.\n I'm so out of my element right now um\nstill getting this error that's good by\nthe way because most\npeople are out of their element so this\nis bad for retention you know it's yeah\n.\n But the real ones are here deep deep in\nthis\nepisode they're with\n[music]\nus now we need to i need to know or now\ni know that what i need to do is add to\nthe template a basically a v02 repet um\nuh path so we need to work out these\nkinks that i worked out on this podcast\nor encountered on this podcast and just\ninclude it.\n But we're here now so let's\ngo ahead and just accept this now i'm\ngoing to hit\nrefresh and what i want to do is we are\non let's go to we are in the.\n So we're in\nsource app page.\n Okay.\n So this is what\nwe're on so we want to stay on this page\nright here i want to be able to edit\nthese on the site the\nexisting page should be the\nevaluation page this is the final page\nwhere i will evaluate all of these\nstartup ideas what i need at the top of\nthe screen or at the top of this page is\na an\ninput so it should look identical.\n So i\nshould be able to add these slides in\nthe identical manner except i want to be\nable to add my startup idea\nto one of these cards and then i want to\nbe able to submit it in which it will\nmove to the evaluation stage which is\npart two let's just try this um okay i\nfeel like there was a little bit of bugs\non this part right here cuz like when i\nhit spit sip.\n I guess that's fine i guess\nthe bar is red um.\n And then yeah it's\nstill kind of buggy.\n But that's okay.\n Yeah\n.\n It's totally.\n Okay.\n I mean just having\n[music]\nsomething we're going to this is a good\nlesson for anyone still watching um\nwe're going to open up perplexity here\nand i'm going to say give me the\nlatest uh\ndocks necessary\nfor what i want to do.\n And i'm actually\ngoing to say latest api docs for what i\nwant to do i am trying to get open ai um\nchat gpt to\nanalyze a uh\ntranscript and fill in data based on\nthat because the the docs are going to\nbe different depending on like just a\nchat\nversus actually having a structured\noutput um it's actually much more\nadvanced than just like a standard chat\nbot.\n So\nyeah perplexity will actually find the\nlatest\ndocumentation it's just going to give\nbetter instructions we can feed it to\ncursor which will allow it to make\nbetter decisions write better code and\nthat's a really big thing for and oh\nwait i need this\ni am using\nnextjs please recreate and you have to\nmake sure that um so it should give us\nnodejs i believe.\n Okay.\n So here it's\ngiving us the\njavascript yes this looks good.\n So we're\njust going to copy this whole thing and\ni'm just going to say here is\nopen ai\ndocumentation all right we'll\nsee.\n I i've never done this before\nactually.\n But i think we could figure it\nout.\n Okay.\n So while we do that i'm have\nyou ever heard of cubby.\n I haven't so i\nwas actually toying with this idea\nbefore so uh cubby is like a it likes\nyou can very quickly save um youtube\nvideos uh and it just automatically\ncopies the transcript.\n And then you can\nlike play it from any point so i can\nlike highlight this part right here and\nplay it from that exact part.\n And you can\nhighlight different parts of it.\n But uh\nlet's just go ahead this is a really\nlong one if i remember.\n Okay um i guess\nlet's just let's just see in the first\n17 minutes of this one i don't want to\nget messed up by too long of context so\nwe'll just copy that real quick.\n And we\ncan close that out um now i'm going to\nhit save and we're going to go to web\nview.\n Okay nice.\n It's coming together\nplease\nwork uh we're gonna paste this in here\n.\n Yeah that looks about like.\n All right so\nlet's see um analyze transcript come on\nthere's no way this\nworks why is open ai giving me like no\nerrors can you\nchange this to\nanthropic please um give me\nanthropic anthropics api for the same\nname use case it looks good though like\nwe have every we have all the shell in\nplace like we have the analyze.\n The\ntranscripts right you could just like\nliterally download your transcript or\nyou could use a transcript api but\nyoutube's starting to block those like\nyou could automatically once your video\nis uploaded and your transcript is\nuploaded it basically just automatically\npulls it analyzes it for startup ideas\nor um i forgot that where we might\nactually have it just be like your\nviewers just uploaded.\n But i really\nwanted this to work see i didn't know\nyou can do that i didn't know you can\njust\nchange from open ai to\nanthropic.\n Yeah.\n I mean it's it changes\nthe code i mean they have different\ndocumentation so like either one we're\ngoing to be downloading we use npm\ninstall anthropic and it has different\nrules.\n Right.\n But i'm pretty sure i've\nalready i'm just going to do this again\njust in case i haven't done it um now\nthat i think about it i'm not sure but\nlet's go to\nsecrets new secret\nvalue um paste that in so this is a next\nthis is what's different than the normal\nprojects that i've been\ncreating why is this giving me no api\nerrors\nnothing i want to at least know what the\nproblem\nis so it's so cool.\n It's kind of like\nyou're you're talking to your engineer\nfriend and they're helping you.\n Yes and\nthe more experience you have clearly i'm\nout of my element because two days ago\nwas the first time i tried nextjs and so\ni had a previous template that i was\nusing with just react react and\ntypescript and the reason we switched is\nbecause you had to set up the a full se\nseparate repet for a backend api but it\nwas actually i understand it a lot\nbetter.\n Uh so like when you enter a new\nterritory which i am right now with\nnextjs you get caught up because you\ndon't know what the problem is because i\nhaven't been dealing with nextjs\nproblems as much um anthropic api key\n.\n Yes we have all that in there um let's\njust hit save all analyze transcript\njust give me an error please\nsee this this actually lets you solve\nthe problem we got an error so ask it to\nfind a way to give you an error which is\ncalled error logging i think um.\n And i'm\njust going to paste in this error\nplease fix this\nproblem insane that you can do that it's\nfun.\n But it's annoying.\n It's so annoying\num.\n And you it sometimes it leads to\nnothing so you got to carve out like two\ntwo or three hour more time than you\nthink you need at first and then\neventually you'll get better once you've\nmastered and if we just use like python\n.\n And we didn't care about how good it\nlooks it would be much easier to create\nbecause python is very straightforward\nand ai is very good at creating it it\njust wouldn't create those you can't use\nv0 for python like using like it's just\nnot compatible um.\n Okay.\n So let's just hit\num save\nall um let me see see\nhere.\n Okay now let's see what the issue\nis um what's interesting about\nsubcategory on\namazon analyze transcripts sending\ntranscript for analysis see now we have\nbetter logging we can actually see\nwhat's happening here.\n Okay we're getting\nanother error um.\n And i'm going to\nask first can you please tell me if this\nis the same error as last time uh if it\nuh and give me some more information on\nthat then fix the error.\n Please i just\nwant to know.\n And we're going to run it\n[music]\nagain.\n Okay.\n We'll try one more time\nplease make sure that the\nanthropic um api response is properly\nparsed and be lenient i really want this\nto work\nso just make this work\nif this doesn't work we'll try what i\nsaid previously because i think that\nwould work because i\nthink it's coming through it's just\nfailing to parse\nit we needed to plea with it.\n H we needed\nto plea with it we needed you got\npersonal with it.\n Yeah we need to\nnegotiate we need\n.\n Yeah.\n I'm pretty sure\nit's anthropic api key\n.\n Yeah um let's hit save all\n.\n Oh is this correct was that one of the\nideas they talked about in the episode\n.\n Yeah.\n I i can't believe i actually can't\nbelieve it it works i literally canot\nbelieve that that's one of what's a lit\nrp what's a lit rpg lit rpg is just this\nyeah literature role playing game.\n It's\nlike a very niche audience that this guy\nnicholas cold was talking about that\nthere's huge opportunity to create books\nfor and were these things that you guys\ntalked about or is it using ai to guess\nwait this actually.\n Kind of cool.\n I might\nuse um i'm pretty sure we talked about\nit and did you use 250,000 per month i'm\njust trying to figure out what the ai is\nguess.\n Okay.\n So it's literally summarizing\nit nice.\n Yeah.\n Okay summarizing\n.\n Yeah\n.\n Um actually i don't know i don't know if\nwe said 250 we might have said like a\n100.\n And i see to the side it says\nprojected market size by 2028.\n So maybe\nit like put some you know compound\nannual growth rate to it.\n No it's good\n.\n It's good you have to play with it um\nit's good to know which where\nit's\num wait.\n And so.\n Okay.\n So.\n Okay.\n So we can\nadd new idea so that added the\nidea\n.\n Okay now i\nwant for\num because if we were doing it on the\nold template i would know how to set it\nup so users could literally go to a site\ncalled\ngreg sippers spit. Comom and they could\nsign in and upload their ideas and then\nyou would once you hit like you could\nhit like show all.\n And then you could\nlike go through them and see like sheila\nsaid that had this.\n And you could\nliterally turn it into a segment in your\npodcast but i don't know how to do it\nwith this new template um but i will get\nthat\num h let's open back up cubby let's see\nwhat happens here\n.\n So let's go later in the\nepisode and let's just\ngrab you guys talked about multiple oh\nthree startup ideas.\n Okay wait.\n Whoa oh it\njust did two in that one i think.\n Yeah it\ndid wait so.\n Niche publishing house\nsip.\n Yeah.\n Ai powered niche publishing\nhouse a publishing company that uses ai\nto generate 80% of niche genre books\nwith human writers to finish the last\n20% is that one you talked about.\n Okay um\nspit only this isn't real is it the only\nfans creator book partnerships\npartnering with only fans creat i think\nwe might have said that.\n Yeah.\n Really okay\n.\n Damn.\n Okay.\n Well then did this might just\nwork actually wait i think we might\nreach a context limit here i\nsaved.\n Let's go\nto different one here let's just grab\nall of them\num this one is the same one what's a\nshorter one five validated startup\nideas.\n Okay.\n So we're just going to do the\nfirst half of this one because i think\nwe're going to get cut off actually it\nis anthropic it might be able to just do\nall of them let's see let's just see if\nwe get an\nerror come on no way all right it just\nworks let's go i am so thank god.\n I was\nfeeling the pressure wait so now let's\njust change this to spit real quick.\n Okay\nfacebook reals optimization tool it\nsounds about about\nright wait this one was with.\n I think i\nactually watched this one\noh no just kidding.\n Yeah this is this is\nthis was.\n Yes this is from this episode\nchris he did talk i just want to make\nsure this is right.\n So he did talk about\nthis okay uh let's sip\nthis programming seo agency franchise\n.\n Yes.\n Okay.\n Ai content repurposing tool\n.\n That's right.\n Yes lifetime warranty\nproduct.\n Yeah all these things all right\nthis is is working we can just go\nthrough and grab all your uh podcasts\nand just like see all the ideas um all\n.\n Right um and we won't have time for it\ntoday but couldn't you automate that yes\n.\n Yeah.\n That would take a little i mean\nthen we would need to um there's i mean\nthat's a that's a really valuable thing\nand if you want to create something of\nvalue.\n Yeah it would probably take me\nanother two hours plus another a while\nto debug and like i might actually need\nhelp to fully deploy it properly because\nthat's a really hard thing like you're\nbasically scraping transcripts then you\nare putting it through this process\nyou're then saving them.\n And um i mean\nactually if we had another hour i'm sure\nwe could figure it out but let's just\npaste this in and let's hit analyze\ntranscript com comment on youtube uh if\nyou want riley to come back some other\ntime if if he'll bless us do you know\nthis\none uh wait i'm just curious on.\n Which\none.\n This is see this this feels like a\ncody schneider just like looking at the\ntranscript.\n Oh damn this just got i just\nuploaded this an hour and 22 minute\nepisode.\n And it got it went from 8 to 15\n.\n So let's just see what this looks like\nfull screen.\n So this is the app startup\nidea evaluator you paste in your\ntranscript and then\num.\n Yeah.\n So then this is this one so you\nhave a linkedin video content agency for\nfounders\num the ai automation consulting for\nsmall businesses i don't know if you\ntalked about that i'm pretty sure these\nare all yes.\n Okay nice.\n All right this\nworks\num o formatting gets a little rough\nafter after 10.\n But that's fine that's\neasily fixable.\n Yeah\n.\n Um.\n Yeah dude i feel like send me your\ninvoice i feel like after this i owe you\n$100,000 from\nthis n dude.\n I'll uh i'll figure out how\nto deploy it.\n We'll um i'll just like\nsend you the the link you can use it\namazing.\n Um so greg we're about an hour\nand 15 minutes after we finished uh the\nepisode.\n But i've added the ability to\njust paste in a link and we can hit load\ntranscript then i can actually type in\nwhat i want to look for so startup ideas\n.\n So i kind of turn this into a general\napp something that i might use to analiz\na transcript and maybe look for ai news\nor coding ideas or something along those\nlines.\n But we can just paste this in and\nhit analyze transcript should load any\nsecond\nnow boom so four uh total ideas\nextracted and now what we can do um and\ni just put jot.\n Like jot it down or not\nright instead of sip or spit now we can\nclick this button and it actually saves\nit right up here so this is sponsorship\nlibrary tool and we can hit jot.\n And we\nsee it up here sponsorship library tool\nand then if we don't want it we can hit\nnot and we have now all done so it's\nkind of a full app experience i think\nright where we ended the episode was\nright when it starts to get fun because\nyou can actually start making um smaller\nchanges and now we can save these to\nyour profile we could in theory add the\nability to edit them so you can refine\nthem and kind of into a little notebook\nof your startup ideas that you have\nsipped or spit it is 7:41.\n And we've\nadded another update so this is where\nwe're at now we can officially sign in\nuh if i refresh the page here you can\nsee it uh.\n But it automatically takes you\nto my profile the app works as normal\nexcept now we can see all sips so we can\nsee all of them.\n And so now every single\nvideo that we do so now if we do\ninteresting ideas.\n And i paste it in\nanother transcript from greg uh hit load\ntranscript uh analyze\ntranscript uh what this will do it\nshould load in the se all sips as this\ninteresting idea is here so what we can\ndo is we can hit uh so let's just sip so\nnow there's five interesting ideas from\nthis one so sip sip you know what let's\nspit this one and we'll sip this one and\nso we go through all those now we can\nsee all sips so now we have interesting\nideas in here where do you want to leave\npeople you know they've watched\nthis and there was ups there were downs\nbut we ended up in a high like what do\nyou want what's one piece of advice you\nwant to give to people.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n So uh i\nguess um i have never claimed to be an\nexpert at this.\n Right i love learning\nlike i love like the act of like\nlearning things and like diving deep\ninto rabbit holes.\n And i'm actually just\nthis why i've partnered with an who's\nvery good at uh at what he does.\n And he's\nan expert developer he is a senior\ndeveloper in every sense he's started\ncompanies and so we're working together\nand we're going to try and create a\ncommunity and eventually help a million\npeople learn how to code without having\nto write how uh uh learning how to write\ncode and by the time you watch this i\nthink it's going to be software\ncomposers tocom right now it's senior uh\nsenior s uh see the fact that i don't\neven know we lally bought the domain\nyesterday and threw the community up and\nwe've uh it's called software composers\nsenior software composers and since the\ntool that you just saw me using was\ncomposers uh was the composer feature\nincursor and you're kind of just\ncomposing your way uh figuring out your\nway through the bugs.\n And so we're\nbasically just creating a community of\npeople who want to do that we're going\nto be releasing very in-depth course uh\nin-depth courses that i'm basically\ngoing to take and and then everything\nthat i learn i'm going to put out step\nby step and we're going to do weekly\ncalls help people through their bugs and\nevery person who joins the uh the\nsoftware composers is going to get like\nweekly help with their projects every\nsingle person's going to create an app\nfully deploy it we're going to talk\nabout stripe integration which i'm\nreally excited about actually monetizing\nthese apps which is actually one of the\nhardest parts of apps especially if you\nhave like multiple different plans um\n.\n But we're gna talk about all of it so\nthat's what i'm working on i'm joining\n.\n Like i i'll definitely join once it's\nlive i for me all this stuff like curse\nor repet all these new tools like it's\nabout getting your hands dirty.\n And it's\nabout you know treating it as like a\ncreative process like even if you don't\nend up you know.\n Yes some of these\nbusinesses some of these projects can\nturn into businesses and who knows like\ncreate real wealth and everything but\nsometimes it's just fun to do this and\nand to like like you said solve problem\nso thanks for coming on here and uh i'll\nsee you uh i'll see you next time.\n Yeah\n.\n See you appreciate it this was a lot of\nfun i'm thank god.\n It worked at the end\nthere thank god.\n It worked dude imagine\ndidn't worked that would have that would\nhave sucked there would have been no it\nwas it would have been a buildup to\nnothing so thank god it worked.\n I had i\nhad fun doing that.\n So.\n Yeah.\n And if you\nlike this sort of stuff like this on\nyoutube to get more of this in your feed\nand subscribe\n[music].
